This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha.

## Credit Scoring Model
## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict an individual's creditworthiness. The goal is to classify applicants into "Good" or "Bad" credit categories based on their financial history and demographic data. Such a model can assist financial institutions in automating and optimizing their loan approval processes, thereby reducing risk and enhancing decision-making accuracy.

## Objective
To build a robust classification model that accurately assesses credit risk using historical financial data, leveraging feature engineering and evaluation metrics to ensure reliability and performance.

## Approach
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

✔ Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Feature Engineering & Selection
✔ Model Training & Evaluation
✔ Performance Analysis & Interpretation

## Key Features

✔ Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features such as debt-to-income ratio and payment behavior indicators.
✔ Handling Imbalanced Data: Applied techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address the imbalance in the target variable.
✔ Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
✔ Model Evaluation: Assessed using metrics such as:
1. Precision
2. Recall
3. F1-Score
4. ROC-AUC Score
5. Confusion Matrix
